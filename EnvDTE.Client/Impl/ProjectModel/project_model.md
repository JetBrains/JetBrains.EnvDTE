# Visual Studio EnvDTE Project Model

## Project Item Hierarchy

- Visual Studio solution folders are modeled as special projects.
- The items inside a solution folder are called *solution items* and are stored inside solution folder's `ProjectItems` property, as `ProjectItem` entries.
- Solution items donâ€™t have their own child `ProjectItems` and if you want to navigate down the hierarchy, you need to access their `Object` or `SubProject` properties.
- If a solution item represents a regular file, its `Object` and `SubProject` will be `null`, and unlike regular files which are part of a project that are of *PhysicalFile* project item kind, this one will just be of *SolutionItem* project item kind.  
- If a solution item represents another (nested) solution folder, or more precisely, a project representing a solution folder, the same things apply as to top level solution folder.
- if a solution item represents a regular project, the rest of its contents are the same, and are not affected by the fact that it is stored inside the solution folder. One exception is the `ParentProjectItem` property which will be set to the containing solution item, while this property is not set for regular projects, outside of the solution folder
